## Summary
After reviewing the data from the dashboard, it appears that most users who subscribe to the program use the bike-sharing program to commute during the weekday, while most general customers use the bike-sharing program during the weekends. Gender does not play a significant role in frequency or length of use of the bike-sharing program, other than the observation that twice as many males use the service compared to females. 

To further explore the use of the bike-sharing program, additional vizualizations could be used to explore the most popular starting and ending destinations during weekdays versus weekends, and between subscribers and general customers to determine the best locations for future bike-sharing programs. It would also be helpful to calculate the distances between the starting and ending points to calculate a rate of travel using the duration of the trips as well.
